# PBS Editor (Release)

## Quick start
1) Unzip this folder into the root of your Pokemon Essentials project.
   - The folder should be alongside PBS/, Graphics/, Audio/, etc.
2) Run PBSEditor.exe.
3) Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser.

## Behavior
- Reads from ./PBS/
- Writes exports to ./PBS_Output/
- Never overwrites your original PBS files.

## Stop the server
- Close the terminal window running PBSEditor.exe.

## Troubleshooting
- If Windows Firewall prompts, allow access for localhost.
- If the page does not load, make sure PBSEditor.exe is still running.
